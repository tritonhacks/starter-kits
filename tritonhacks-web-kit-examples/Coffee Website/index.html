            According to one legend, ancestors of today's Oromo people in a
            region of Kaffa in Ethiopia were the first to recognize the
            energizing effect of the coffee plant. However, no direct evidence
            that has been found earlier than the 15th century indicating who
            among the African populations used it as a stimulant, or where
            coffee was first cultivated. The story of Kaldi, the 9th-century
            Ethiopian goatherd who discovered coffee when he noticed how excited
            his goats became after eating the beans from a coffee plant, did not
            appear in writing until 1671 and is probably apocryphal
