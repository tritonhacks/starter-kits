                    <p>
                        Chess is a recreational board game played by two players. 
                        The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent's 
                        king whereby the king is under "check" and has no further 
                        moves.

                    <p> 
                        Chess has recently enjoyed a large uptick of online interest for a variety of reasons
                        though some of the biggest factors include the corona crisis, series of collaboration streams 
                        by prominent chess players (notable Hikaru Nakamura) with popular twitch streamers, and the release 
                        of the popular T.V show, The Queen's Gambit. As of 2021, chess has broken all-time records in numbers
                        of views on sites such as Youtube and concurrent viewers on streaming sites such as Twitch. As chess becomes more 
                        popular though, the "old-guard" has began a gatekeeping backlash leading to questions 
                        on if chess' rising popularity is truly a good thing.
